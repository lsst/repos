repos (`repos.yaml`)
===

This repo primarily contains the `repos.yaml` configuration file used by
[`lsst/lsst_build`](https://github.com/lsst/lsst_build) to locate source
repositories when preparing for a build.

**Note that This repository is governed by a 'self merge' policy, which allows
for a PR to be merged without review upon a successful CI build.**
