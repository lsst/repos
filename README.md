==========

This repository contains the [`repos.yaml`](etc/repos.yaml) configuration file
used by [`lsst/lsst_build`](https://github.com/lsst/lsst_build) to locate
source code repositories when preparing for a build.

> **Important Note:** This repository is governed by a 'self merge' policy,
> which allows for a PR to be merged without review upon a successful CI build.
